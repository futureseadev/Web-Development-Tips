I was using FileZilla but after some thinking I decided that I wanted to take advantage of being able to use a registered domain name. I rebuilt everything on Node.js and now all of the the ui you see is using React. Since bluehost doesn't have support for Node.js as far as I could tell I pushed the website to Heroku and pointed my registed domain name to my Heroku app."
