    content: "Welcome to my website! It was quite an adventure getting everything setup. I was using FileZilla but after some thinking I decided that I wanted to take advantage of being able to use a registered domain name. I rebuilt everything on Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. Since bluehost doesn't have support for Node.js as far as I could tell, I pushed the website to Heroku and pointed my registered domain name to my Heroku app. The site is still fairly rough, but I hope to have everything fine tuned by the end of this class. Google Analytics was also fairly easy to port into node using an npm package called react-ga. I tested it out and atleast the Real-Time is working! So, I think everything should be good."
