    content: "Welcome to my website! It has been quite an adventure getting everything setup! I was using FileZilla, but after some thinking I decided that I wanted to take advantage of being able to use a registered domain name. The backend of this site is built on Node.js and the frontend is built in React.js. Since bluehost doesn't have support for Node.js as far as I could tell, I pushed the website to Heroku and pointed my registered domain name to my Heroku app. I've also added Google Analytics which was fairly easy to integrate using an NPM package called react-ga. This site is still fairly rough, but I hope to have things fine tuned by the end of class :)."
